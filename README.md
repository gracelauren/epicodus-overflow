# Welcome to Epicodus Overflow

Have you ever been a student at Epicodus?
Have you ever not been perfect at coding immediately after picking it up?
Have you ever wanted to talk to another human about your shortcomings?
Have you ever wanted to comment on another person's shortcomings, laughing at them for forgetting the .concat() method?
If any of these sound like you, we built this app with you in mind.

Epicodus Overflow was created to give current Epicodus students a place to reach out for help from other students. While working on daily projects,  students often seek help from other pairs by walking around the classroom and asking other pairs at random for help. Epicodus Overflow will help students quickly find others dealing with similar error messages or problems, as well as provide an online venue for conversation about submitted errors.
