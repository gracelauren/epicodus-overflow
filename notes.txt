Using: Angular.js, Firebase

https://www.firebase.com/pricing.html



Features needed:
1. Firebase implementation
   a) see Gabe & Jay's Slacker News

2. filter:
   a) errors:
      - filter by ditto?, but new errors appear above
      - see nerdNews example, using id
   b) replies:
      - add oneUp method to replies.upvotes
      - filter by upvotes?
      - clear comments

3. awesome style
  textareas?
  mark required where applicable



Possible features:
- {{item.keys(item.replies).length}}
- angular animations
- full CRUD functionality (but delete not open to public,
    hopefully Firebase will provide easy way to do this)
- archive sorted by month (pull from database?)







Objects:
- error {
    title: title, (max length)
    error: message, (copy pasted error message)
    details: elaborate,
    names: names,
    time: time,
    language: language, (ie JS, HTML, framework?)
    browser: checkbox default chrome,
    replies: hasMany/ whatever it's called,
    ditto: clickable badge or button or something to indicate significance/ prevalence
}

- replies {
    names: names,
    message: reply message,
    upvotes: similar to ditto,
    time: time
}

(default sorting should be by upvote then time)
